## Processing workflows
### Cookbooks
Collections of tasks which need to be comprehensively learned (e.g. Azure commands and procedures for [AZ-103](az-103.md))
1. **Number** tasks for easy reference and linking in markdown
2. **Catalog** tasks and desciptions in a spreadsheet
3. **Copy** catalog with task and description to markdown
4. **Fill** markdown with syntax, producing a true reference of the source's syntax
5. **Map** each form-based feature (e.g. commands) to tasks in a spreadsheet (Command | Task) 
6. **Index** form-based features at the top of the markdown as a concordance
