Ruby library "socket" allows integration with [Twitch's IRC API](https://twitchapps.com/tmi), which provides an oauth token which can be stored as password. Command `write_to_system` appears to be  what is needed to concatenate IRC commands `PASS #{@password`, `NICK #{@nickname}`, `USER #{@nickname} 0 * #{@nickname}`, and `JOIN #@{channel}`

From the REPL, you instantiate an instance of the class after running the script, which will allow passing messages to the chat room by using an instance method
```rb
bot = TwitchBot.new
bot.write_to_chat "Hello world"
```
