## Notes
### Azure DevOps Podcast
#### ADP 48
Testing and static analysis
Several different types of automated tests
  - **Unit tests** test functionality without dependencies (i.e. file system, database, network, etc). `XUnit` is recommended for .NET Core
  - **Integration tests** 
  - **Functional tests** test the full stack of the system, except for the client. ASP .NET core functional tests are easily written.
  - **UI tests** simulate user interaction using systems like Selenium, which uses .NET, or Cypress, which uses JavaScript.

Test coverage metrics are a double-edged sword, because they incentivize developers to "gold-plate" their code by implementing spurious tests which pass easily.
**Cyclomatic complexity** refers to the number of pathways through the code, measured at the method level.
### CloudSkills.fm
#### CSFM 2
> "Infrastructure as Code in the Cloud"
- An alternative job title to DevOps Engineer is "Infrastructure Developer"
- Infrastructure as Code and automation are terms that refer to the use of deployment templates to provision resources reproducibly.
- Automation templates are especially useful when testing software. The development environment for that version of the application can be provisioned and comprehensively tested before risking the production environment.
- Go for the Azure Solutions Architect Expert, since it demonstrates the skills needed
#### CSFM 3
> "Cloud Migration Strategy"
- Azure's Site Recovery has been a game-changer that AWS has had no answer for, until Amazon acquired CloudEndure, which had offered a similar service for multiple cloud providers.
- "architectural patterns"
#### CSFM 5
> "Automation with PowerShell"
- A good project idea is to spin up a Windows 10 VM in Azure
#### CSFM 29
> "Building Serverless Apps on AWS". []
> "Unless you're an infrastructure company, infrastructure is overhead."
- Guest Yan Cui discusses AWS Lambda's market dominance.
- It makes no sense to worry about migration from one cloud provider to another before it becomes an issue: CAPEX (capital expenditure) vs. OPEX (operating expenditure). And transferring Compute is easy.
- Although Lambda is capable, there are hard limits. For example, there is a limit on increasing concurrency of 500 per minute. So highly spiky workloads that exceed that limit make Lambda less appealing.
- When analyzing costs, we shouldn't fall for the fallacy of thinking that minimizing the AWS bill is equivalent to reducing infrastructure costs. Some solutions that may drastically reduce monthly costs on AWS, such as Lambda, may actually require much higher costs to support from competent engineers.
### Coder Radio
#### CR 361
> "ZEEEE Shell!". [coder.show](https://coder.show/361): 2019/06/10.
  - Apple changing from bash to zsh for the next release of Mac OS X
  - Designing UIs in Swift
    - Functional programming
#### CR 325
> "Clojure Calisthenics". [coder.show](https://coder.show/325): 2018/09/07.
- Wes Payne is a big fan of Clojure, in particular with the professionalism of the clojure community. Clojure is not as closely tied to Java as it was in its inception when it was a "JAR", but it still needs a JVM.
### Destination Linux
### Hacker Public Radio
#### HPR 1938
> "How I prepare HPR shows". [hpr.org](hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1938**full**shownotes.html)
  - `make`
#### HPR 2107
  - Source: "Makefiles for everyday use". [hpr.org](https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=2107)
  - `make`
### Kubernetes Podcast from Google
#### K8S 67
Orka, with Chris Chapman\
Orka is a virtualization layer for Mac build infrastructure offered by hosting company MacStadium. iPhone architecture and security make building for that platform very different. Virtual Mac instances first became possible in Snow Leopard, but the EULA allows only 2 VMs per machine. MacStadium is an enterprise-scale cloud for Apple. A typical lifecycle for an iOS build begins with a simulator, followed by a physical test, typically in a build farm of physical iOS devices.  
### Late Night Linux
#### LNL 65
  - KDE App page
  - Google Stadia
  - How can the FLOSS community take advantage of the opportunity presented by the sunsetting of Windows 7?
### Linux Unplugged
#### LU 315

### Talk Python
#### TP 213
> "WebAssembly and CPython".
- Web Assembly is gaining steam in the developer community, and several Web Assembly projects are in train. Pyodide is the SciPy stack into web assembly. The interpreter is on the order of 40MB, which is still too large for convenient use on the web. Compiling to CPython may not be the correct answer in the future as technology evolves. A straight Python to web-assembly compilation target would have some difficulties, but it is possible. If you turn Web Assembly as a general interpreter layer, various possibilities open up.
#### TP 216
> "Digging into Visual Studio Code".
#### TP 224
> "12 lessons from 100 days of code".
- Netlify will watch changes to a GitHub repo as a continuous delivery platform for static sites.
