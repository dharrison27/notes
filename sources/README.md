#### AWS 329
Choosing a Database Platform\
The historical motivation for the invention of relational databases was minimizing the cost of storage by eliminating duplication. At the turn of the century, as storage cost fell, other database paradigms emerged, producing **7 fundamental categories of data**:
  - **Relational** data
  - **Key-value** data: divided into **key-to-blob** storage and **key-to-document** storage
  - **In-memory** storage: i.e. Redis, MemCacheD
  - **Graph** storage
  - **Search**: introspection into natural-language queries, i.e. **Managed Elastic Search**
  - **Time-series**
  - **Ledger**

The recommended approach to select a database is to determine the **access pattern** needed. Organizations should be open to encouraging innovation by using more than one database, rather than overemphasizing reducing the cost of infrastructure by insisting on using a single, monolithic database that may not be suited to every business purpose.

Testing and static analysis
Several different types of automated tests
  - **Unit tests** test functionality without dependencies (i.e. file system, database, network, etc). `XUnit` is recommended for .NET Core
  - **Integration tests** 
  - **Functional tests** test the full stack of the system, except for the client. ASP .NET core functional tests are easily written.
  - **UI tests** simulate user interaction using systems like Selenium, which uses .NET, or Cypress, which uses JavaScript.

Test coverage metrics are a double-edged sword, because they incentivize developers to "gold-plate" their code by implementing spurious tests which pass easily.
**Cyclomatic complexity** refers to the number of pathways through the code, measured at the method level.

> "Building Serverless Apps on AWS". []
> "Unless you're an infrastructure company, infrastructure is overhead."
- Guest Yan Cui discusses AWS Lambda's market dominance.
- It makes no sense to worry about migration from one cloud provider to another before it becomes an issue: CAPEX (capital expenditure) vs. OPEX (operating expenditure). And transferring Compute is easy.
- Although Lambda is capable, there are hard limits. For example, there is a limit on increasing concurrency of 500 per minute. So highly spiky workloads that exceed that limit make Lambda less appealing.
- When analyzing costs, we shouldn't fall for the fallacy of thinking that minimizing the AWS bill is equivalent to reducing infrastructure costs. Some solutions that may drastically reduce monthly costs on AWS, such as Lambda, may actually require much higher costs to support from competent engineers.

Windows Server Containers, with Patrick Lang\
[Web](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/070-windows-server-containers/)\
##### What is a Windows container, and how is it different from a Linux container?\
Windows server containers, like Linux containers, package dependencies. Windows offers two base images: **Windows Server Core** and **Nano Server**. 
##### Windows applications can run on Windows using Wine, and Linux applications can run on Windows using WSL. How are Windows and Linux applications different?\
The differences between Windows and Linux containers originate in historical differences. Linux was developed with the goal of producing a stable kernel with a consistent application binary interface and limited syscalls in order to move applications from other commercial Unix-type OSes. In contrast, Windows was developed to be an entire operating system, not just a kernel, including APIs like Win16 and Win32. The border between kernel and user mode was always much blurrier than in Linux. The concept of a **session** was innovated to handle the problem of what to do when multiple users are making inputs simultaneously. A Windows container is essentially equivalent to a headless session.\
##### Can I deploy an application with user interaction with Windows containers?
Windows Server containers are focused on running headless applications. Tools like the **Windows Application Converter** are available to assist in adapting applications for publication on the Windows App Store or the Windows Enterprise Store. But Windows Server Containers are focused on headless apps.
##### How did the Windows Server Container come about?
Before the release of Windows Server 2016, developers were inspired by the success of Docker, which packaged dependencies and configurations into an easy-to-install package. By the time of the release of Windows Server 2016, a preview of Docker was ready for Windows containers. This made containers a concept that transcended operating systems.\
##### Is the isolation model different between Windows and Linux containers?
Every Windows installation has its own security database that is handled by the local security agent, and for every new user a unique binary identifier is generated that is unique to that database. Containers also create their own database upon creation.
##### How do you work with identity in containers?
Without Active Directory, every container is completely isolated. Active Directory has been around since Windows Server 2000, but the replication interval for AD databases is prohibitively long, which is too long for container applications. The solution is Group-Managed Service Accounts, which is a security principal that can be used by multiple users and computers. This turned out to be perfect for containers, but it still required the machine to be domain-joined, which is something we wanted to avoid for containers because of the delay in replication, as mentioned
##### What had to change in Kubernetes to support Windows containers? And what had to change in Windows to support Kubernetes?
The initial target for Windows Server 2016 was support for Docker and Docker Swarm, which implemented a **network plugin** model and a **storage plugin** model, which were deferred but still tightly coupled to the Docker engine. In Kubernetes, network and storage management was handled by the kubelet calling additional plugins like the **Container Network Interface** or the **Container Storage Interface** with a different order of operations. This necessitated the development of network namespaces in Windows, which were released in 2017 and 2018 for Windows Server, which allowed the creation of multiple containers with the same IP and the same virtual NIC. Storage also necessitated the creation of a mapped volume using symlinks in order to create a filesystem.
##### There are parts of the Kubernetes stack that are built with Linux in mind, i.e. KubeProxy is basically a mess of `iptables` rules. Did you have to build an equivalent for Windows nodes?
For the network control plane, configuration was exposed in what's called the **Host Networking Service (HNS)**. Another service called the **Virtual Networking Platform** made it possible to write granular rules governing how individual packets are forwarded, rewritten, and how policy is applied to them. This functions analogously to `iptables`. KubeProxy was updated to talk to the HNS to set those up.
##### How did you merge Windows Identity with Kubernetes access controls?
##### Which parts of Kubernetes run on Windows?
Today, our focus is on being able to run the Kubelet and KubeProxy, which allows you to add a Windows node to an existing Kubernetes cluster.
##### Can GPUs be used in Windows containers?
There is support to share the GPU with what's already on the node, which allows you to use some DirectX APIs.
##### How should someone with an app running on an old version of Windows Server update it to get it running on a Windows container?
The container has to run Windows Server 2016 or newer. So the first question to ask is, can this application work on Windows Server 2016 or 2019? The application can't rely on a component that has since been deprecated, but some frameworks like .NET Core offer compatibility for versions of .NET as early as 2.0, which dates back to the early 2000s.\
You have to examine your existing runbooks and implement them in an automatable form that is supported by containers. 
##### Once I have a container, I have to keep it up to date. What do I have to do on Patch Tuesday?
On Patch Tuesday, open up the Docker file and update the top line that says "from". Then rebuild and redeploy it. Microsoft has begun implementing security patches into updated Windows container images that are available on Docker Hub. Pull those down and rebuild the container. Deploy it and shut down the old one.
##### You can only run a container that has the same major version as the host operating system. What about when the host operating system changes?
Moving from one patch to another won't cause any problems, but going to the next version of Windows Server will cause an incompatibility. We are working on addressing that using Hyper-V isolation to bring up the kernel version need to run the container, but that has not yet been integrated into Kubernetes. Hyper-V runs much better under `containerd`, but work still needs to be done.
##### How did you get started with Windows and containers?
I was in the right place at the right time. I was supervising the Hyper-V team at Microsoft for most of the past ten years, and that team worked closely with the kernel team. And when we began to look at how to build containers, we quickly realized the talent to do that work had already been marshaled. We formed a team from my personnel and then formed a partnership with Docker which taught us a lot.
##### How should someone interested in Windows Server containers start using them?
If you have a Windows 10 machine, Docker for Windows can run containers on Linux or Windows, and you can switch between them using the system tray icon. Go to [aka.ms/windowscontainers](https://aka.ms/windowscontainers). If you don't have a machine, all the major cloud providers allow you to form a Windows Server or Windows 10 VM. 
##### How can open-source contributors assist in the development of Windows containers?
Get connected with the Kubernetes community repo, every SIG has a folder in there which links to our weekly meetings and agenda. Get an invite to the Kubernetes Slack server and join the SIG Windows Slack channel.

Orka, with Chris Chapman\
Orka is a virtualization layer for Mac build infrastructure offered by hosting company MacStadium. iPhone architecture and security make building for that platform very different. Virtual Mac instances first became possible in Snow Leopard, but the EULA allows only 2 VMs per machine. MacStadium is an enterprise-scale cloud for Apple. A typical lifecycle for an iOS build begins with a simulator, followed by a physical test, typically in a build farm of physical iOS devices.

Philip Muller discussed the transition of Manjaro to a for-profit business model.\
Chrome OS has become Linux for the masses, in particular now that support for Linux applications has improved, and it has had great success penetrating the education market.\
CloudReady OS allows you to install Chrome OS on other hardware. It is available in free and paid commercial editions. They are essentially reselling a version of Chrome OS with their commercial support which can be installed on any x86 machine. It offers a choice of Linux distros, or even a combination of them, including Debian.\
Chris reflects on how Chrome OS has evolved since he first tried it in 2014. It has become much more complicated and powerful since its launch, and grudgingly admits he likes it, in particular how users can login with their own unique Linux environments.

#### PodCTL 5
Pivotal Container Services (PKS) started as a project between Google and Pivotal originally called "Kubo" which takes the BOSH installer from Cloud Foundry Foundation and installs a Kubernetes instance. Kubernetes doesn't have an official installer, and many open-source solutions have been implemented. **Time to Success** is a metric used by developers that want to test out new products or technologies. **MiniKube** is the most commonly used Kubernetes Engine for installation on a laptop for experimentation or learning purposes. **MiniShift** is to OpenShift what MiniKube is to Kubernetes. Both of these tools provide a **single-node**, **single-master** environment. \
**Kubeadm** is the official Kubernetes installer from the CNCF, but it is not widely used because it doesn't deploy multiple Kubernetes masters. Kubernetes has the concept of masters that provide the **control plane** and **workers** which run Kubelets. In reality, the masters are just Kubernetes worker nodes that are running only Kubernetes core services, and those are the first pods that are deployed by K8S.
**Kargo** builds highly available containers.\
There are two main types of container engine installers: normal ones that install locally and interactively ask what Linux host is desired, and thne another type that interfaces with an IaaS provider and demands resources from it. The tools typically defined as configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, Salt, and Terraform are also typically used to package containerized software and can perform orchestration. Kargo, for example, uses Terraform to build the nodes and then Ansible to do the actual installation. OpenShift's installer uses Ansible.\
**Prometheus** has become the go-to open-source monitoring and alerting tool. Other tools include the **ELK stack**, the **EFK stack**, and **Loggly**.

- Web Assembly is gaining steam in the developer community, and several Web Assembly projects are in train. Pyodide is the SciPy stack into web assembly. The interpreter is on the order of 40MB, which is still too large for convenient use on the web. Compiling to CPython may not be the correct answer in the future as technology evolves. A straight Python to web-assembly compilation target would have some difficulties, but it is possible. If you turn Web Assembly as a general interpreter layer, various possibilities open up.
