329         | Choosing a Database Platform | [Notes](#aws-329)
#### AWS 329
The historical motivation for the invention of relational databases was minimizing the cost of storage by eliminating duplication. At the turn of the century, as storage cost fell, other database paradigms emerged, producing **7 fundamental categories of data**:
  - **Relational** data
  - **Key-value** data: divided into **key-to-blob** storage and **key-to-document** storage
  - **In-memory** storage: i.e. Redis, MemCacheD
  - **Graph** storage
  - **Search**: introspection into natural-language queries, i.e. **Managed Elastic Search**
  - **Time-series**
  - **Ledger**

The recommended approach to select a database is to determine the **access pattern** needed. Organizations should be open to encouraging innovation by using more than one database, rather than overemphasizing reducing the cost of infrastructure by insisting on using a single, monolithic database that may not be suited to every business purpose.

Testing and static analysis
Several different types of automated tests
  - **Unit tests** test functionality without dependencies (i.e. file system, database, network, etc). `XUnit` is recommended for .NET Core
  - **Integration tests** 
  - **Functional tests** test the full stack of the system, except for the client. ASP .NET core functional tests are easily written.
  - **UI tests** simulate user interaction using systems like Selenium, which uses .NET, or Cypress, which uses JavaScript.

Test coverage metrics are a double-edged sword, because they incentivize developers to "gold-plate" their code by implementing spurious tests which pass easily.
**Cyclomatic complexity** refers to the number of pathways through the code, measured at the method level.

- An alternative job title to DevOps Engineer is "Infrastructure Developer"
- Infrastructure as Code and automation are terms that refer to the use of deployment templates to provision resources reproducibly.
- Automation templates are especially useful when testing software. The development environment for that version of the application can be provisioned and comprehensively tested before risking the production environment.
- Go for the Azure Solutions Architect Expert, since it demonstrates the skills needed

> "Unless you're an infrastructure company, infrastructure is overhead."
- Guest Yan Cui discusses AWS Lambda's market dominance.
- It makes no sense to worry about migration from one cloud provider to another before it becomes an issue: CAPEX (capital expenditure) vs. OPEX (operating expenditure). And transferring Compute is easy.
- Although Lambda is capable, there are hard limits. For example, there is a limit on increasing concurrency of 500 per minute. So highly spiky workloads that exceed that limit make Lambda less appealing.
- When analyzing costs, we shouldn't fall for the fallacy of thinking that minimizing the AWS bill is equivalent to reducing infrastructure costs. Some solutions that may drastically reduce monthly costs on AWS, such as Lambda, may actually require much higher costs to support from competent engineers.
#### CSFM 40
Mike talks about his own work history, starting as a customer service representative working at AOL in the 1990s, then working tech support at Gateway, ultimately ending up in Phoenix where he remains today. 
> [Getting certified] is a no-brainer. If you're not looking at certifications and you're thinking about doing this career transition, that's a mistake. So don't even get into this if you're not willing to do the certifications at this point because it's way too important, there are way too many people who are looking for that in these job openings.

71          | `containerd` with Derek McGowan | [Notes](#k8s-71) [Web](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/071-containerd/)

#### K8S 71
Containerd is a container runtime that manages all the resources related to containers. It sits right below the Kubernetes `kubelet` as well as Docker. Beneath containerd there is the runtime, most commonly **runC**, which is the reference implementation of the OCR open container.\
Containerd was originally designed to interface directly with runC so that Docker could be decoupled from the actual containers. Since then, containerd grew to include image resources, which means it could entirely replace Docker.\
`ctr` is an unsupported tool that used for debugging containerd.\
Container metrics (logging and monitoring information) is exposed through **Prometheus**. \
#### K8S 70
Windows server containers, like Linux containers, package dependencies. Windows offers two base images: **Windows Server Core** and **Nano Server**. Windows Server containers are focused on running headless applications.\
The differences between Windows and Linux containers originate in historical differences. Linux was developed with the goal of producing a stable kernel with a consistent application binary interface and limited syscalls in order to move applications from other commercial Unix-type OSes. In contrast, Windows was developed to be an entire operating system, not just a kernel, including APIs like Win16 and Win32. The border between kernel and user mode was always much blurrier than in Linux. The concept of a **session** was innovated to handle the problem of what to do when multiple users are making inputs simultaneously. A Windows container is essentially equivalent to a headless session.\
Every Windows installation has its own security database that is handled by the local security agent, and for every new user a unique binary identifier is generated that is unique to that database. Containers also create their own database upon creation. Without Active Directory, every container is completely isolated. Active Directory has been around since Windows Server 2000, but the replication interval for AD databases is too long for container applications. The solution is **Group-Managed Service Accounts**, which is a **security principal** that can be used by multiple users and computers. This turned out to be perfect for containers, but it still required the machine to be domain-joined, which is something we wanted to avoid for containers because of the delay in replication, as mentioned.\
The initial target for Windows Server 2016 was support for Docker and Docker Swarm, which implemented a **network plugin** model and a **storage plugin** model, which were deferred but still tightly coupled to the Docker engine. In Kubernetes, network and storage management was handled by the kubelet calling additional plugins like the **Container Network Interface** or the **Container Storage Interface** with a different order of operations. This necessitated the development of network namespaces in Windows, which were released in 2017 and 2018 for Windows Server, which allowed the creation of multiple containers with the same IP and the same virtual NIC. Storage also necessitated the creation of a mapped volume using symlinks in order to create a filesystem.\
For the network control plane, configuration was exposed in what's called the **Host Networking Service (HNS)**. Another service called the **Virtual Networking Platform** made it possible to write granular rules governing how individual packets are forwarded, rewritten, and how policy is applied to them. This functions analogously to `iptables`. KubeProxy was updated to talk to the HNS to set those up.\
If you have a Windows 10 machine, Docker for Windows can run containers on Linux or Windows, and you can switch between them using the system tray icon. Go to [aka.ms/windowscontainers](https://aka.ms/windowscontainers). If you don't have a machine, all the major cloud providers allow you to form a Windows Server or Windows 10 VM. \

#### K8S 67
Orka is a virtualization layer for Mac build infrastructure offered by hosting company MacStadium. iPhone architecture and security make building for that platform very different. Virtual Mac instances first became possible in Snow Leopard, but the EULA allows only 2 VMs per machine. MacStadium is an enterprise-scale cloud for Apple. A typical lifecycle for an iOS build begins with a simulator, followed by a physical test, typically in a build farm of physical iOS devices.  
#### K8S 13
**Cloud Services Platform**: Google hybrid cloud software, comprising a set of software and services that work both on-premises and in GCP and are managed by GCP\
3 components that form the core of Cloud services Platform:
  - **GKE On-Prem**: Kubernetes for on-premises environments.
  - **GKE Policy Manager**: allows admins to gain centralized control over the hybrid environment
  - **Istio**

**Kubernetes Operators**: allow you to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes clusters, such as Spark Operator, Airflow Operator, etc.
#### K8S 12
Kubernetes started at Google at the same time as Google Compute Engine, as developers thought deeply about how to improve the value proposition of virtual machines. Joe Beda was an early user of Borg, and him and others pushed for it to be released as a product. However, it was decided that Borg and Omega specifically were too closely aligned with internal Google products, so a new open-source product was imagined, although there was internal resistance to opening it up to the community completely.\
Red Hat's buy-in early in the history of Kubernetes by deciding to use Kubernetes as a basis. Namespaces are called projects in OpenShift.\
Joe Beda is an advocate of a microkernel, minimalist architecture for the Kubernetes core with additional features layered on top. Beda is also

Philip Muller discussed the transition of Manjaro to a for-profit business model.\
Chrome OS has become Linux for the masses, in particular now that support for Linux applications has improved, and it has had great success penetrating the education market.\
CloudReady OS allows you to install Chrome OS on other hardware. It is available in free and paid commercial editions. They are essentially reselling a version of Chrome OS with their commercial support which can be installed on any x86 machine. It offers a choice of Linux distros, or even a combination of them, including Debian.\
Chris reflects on how Chrome OS has evolved since he first tried it in 2014. It has become much more complicated and powerful since its launch, and grudgingly admits he likes it, in particular how users can login with their own unique Linux environments.

#### PodCTL 5
**Pivotal Container Services (PKS)** started as a project between Google and Pivotal originally called "Kubo" which takes the BOSH installer from Cloud Foundry Foundation and installs a Kubernetes instance. Kubernetes doesn't have an official installer, and many open-source solutions have been implemented. **Time to Success** is a metric used by developers that want to test out new products or technologies. **MiniKube** is the most commonly used Kubernetes Engine for installation on a laptop for experimentation or learning purposes. **MiniShift** is to OpenShift what MiniKube is to Kubernetes. Both of these tools provide a **single-node**, **single-master** environment. \
**Kubeadm** is the official Kubernetes installer from the CNCF, but it is not widely used because it doesn't deploy multiple Kubernetes masters. Kubernetes has the concept of masters that provide the **control plane** and **workers** which run Kubelets. In reality, the masters are just Kubernetes worker nodes that are running only Kubernetes core services, and those are the first pods that are deployed by K8S.
**Kargo** builds highly available containers.\
There are two main types of container engine installers: normal ones that install locally and interactively ask what Linux host is desired, and thne another type that interfaces with an IaaS provider and demands resources from it. The tools typically defined as configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, Salt, and Terraform are also typically used to package containerized software and can perform orchestration. Kargo, for example, uses Terraform to build the nodes and then Ansible to do the actual installation. OpenShift's installer uses Ansible.\
**Prometheus** has become the go-to open-source monitoring and alerting tool. Other tools include the **ELK stack**, the **EFK stack**, and **Loggly**.

Web Assembly is gaining steam in the developer community, and several Web Assembly projects are in train. **Pyodide** is the **SciPy** stack into web assembly. The interpreter is on the order of 40MB, which is still too large for convenient use on the web. Compiling to CPython may not be the correct answer in the future as technology evolves. A straight Python to web-assembly compilation target would have some difficulties, but it is possible. If you turn Web Assembly as a general interpreter layer, various possibilities open up.
