## Skill 1.1: Manage Azure Subscriptions

#### Assign administrator permissions
Azure methods of administering access to resources can be divided into two groups
  1. __Classic__ subscription administration roles 
    - Account Administrator
    - Service Administrator
    - Co-Administrator
  2. __Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)__

##### Classic roles
Classic subscription administrators have full access to a subcription. They can access resources through Azure Portal, ARM APIs (PowerShell and CLI), and classic deployment model APIs. 

By default, the account that is used to sign up for a subscription is automatically set as both __Account Administrator__ and __Service Administrator__. There can only be one Account Administrator per account and only 1 Service Administrator per subscription. __Co-Administrators__ have the same access as Service Administrators, and there can be 200 of them per subscription, but cannot change the association of subscriptions to directories.

Current assignments for classic admins can be seen in the __Properties blade__ of a subscription in Azure Portal.
Co-Administrator assignments can be added by opening the __Access Control (IAM)__ blade of a subscription, then clicking the __Add co-administrator__ button. 

##### RBAC roles
RBAC roles are supported only by Azure Portal and the ARM APIs. Access is applied to a __scope__, which includes subscriptions, resource groups, or resources. 

RBAC roles can be used to grant rights to 2 types of principals:
  1. __User principal__: identity associated with a user or group of users.
  2. __Service principal__: identity associated with an application.

There are more than __70__ built-in RBAC roles, allowing fine-grained access management, but __4__ of them are foundational:
  1. __Owner__ has full access to all resources and __can__ delegate access. Service Administrator and Co-Administrators are assigned this role at the subscription scope.
  2. __Contributor__ can create and manage all resources, but __cannot__ delegate access.
  3. __Reader__ can view resources.
  4. __User Access Administrator__ only manages user access to resources.

To assign an RBAC role to a subscription, open the __Subscription__, then the __Access Control (IAM)__ blades, then click __Add Role Assignment__. This will open a dialog box where you can select a __Role__ (e.g. Owner) then __Select__ a target principal.

RBAC roles can also be applied to a subscription through __Management Groups__, which represent the recommended practice for ensuring consistent application of tenant-wide security. Management groups form a hierarchy where each child inherits policy from its single parent while having additional controls. There is a singel Management Group at the root of the hierarchy, associated with the Azure AD tenant (which is associated, in turn, with a subscription) that cannot be moved or deleted. 

Azure Policy can be applied at various __scopes__. For example, a policy applied to a subscription is said to be at the "subscription scope". Policy can also be applied to Management Groups, which is an additional scope above subscription. In this way, several subscriptions can inherit a single policy through a Management Group.

There is a built-in role named __Resource Policy Contributor__, which includes access to most Policy operations and should be considered privileged.

#### Configure cost center quotas and tagging
There are 2 types of quota that apply to subscriptions:
  1. __Resource quotas__ trigger alarms when resource creation and consumption hit a threshold. These are not to be confused with __resource limits__ which can stop resources from being created, whereas quotas can not.
  2. __Spending quotas__ trigger alarms when spending has reached a thresthold.

These are facilitated through the use of tags, which allow categorization of resource groups and resources.

##### Configure resource quotas
To view resource quotas for a subscription, go to the subscription in Azure Portal and open the __Usage + quotas__ blade. From there you can select resources and then click the __Request Increase__ button.

PowerShell commands used with resource quotas:
  - `Get-AzVMUsage`: view current usage of vCPU quotas
  - `Get-AzStorageUsage`: view current usage of storage service

#### Configure cost center quotas
Budgets can be viewed and administered in the __Cost Management + Billing__ blade. Users must be at least Reader to a subscription to view, and Contributor to create and manage, budgets. Specialized roles that grant access to Cost Management include
  - __Cost Management contributor__
  - __Cost Management reader__

To create a budget, open __Cost Management + Billing__, then __Subscriptions__, select a subscription, then click __Budgets__. Then click __+ Add__, which produces a Create budget blade. The created budget can be seen in the __Budgets__ blade.

PowerShell commands used with budgets:
  - `Get-AzResourceGroup` retrieve Resource Group object
  - `Set-AzResourceGroup` apply a tag to a resource group with __no preexisting tags__
  - `.Tags` method that retrieves Tag collection from a resource group
  - `.Add()` method used to add tags to a resource group that __already has__ tags.

```powershell
$tags = (Get-AzResourceGroup -Name hrgroup).Tags
$tags.Add("Owner","user@contoso.com")
Set-AzResourceGroup -Tag $tags -Name hrgroup
```

```powershell
$r = Get-AzResource -ResourceName hrvm1 -ResourceGroupName hrgroup
Set-AzResource -Tag @{ CostCode="1001"; Environment="Production" } -ResourceId
$r.ResourceId -Force
```

Add tags to a resource using the `Add()` method
```powershell
$r = Get-AzResource -ResourceName hrvm1 -ResourceGroupName hrgroup
$r.Tags.Add("Owner","user@contoso.com")
Set-AzResource -Tag $r.Tags -ResourceId $r.ResourceId -Force
```

#### Configure Azure subscription policies
__Azure Policy__ is a service that can create, assign, and manage policies to enforce governance. Where Azure RBAC controls individual user and group access at specific scopes, Azure Policy allows environment to be governed for all users at a specified scope regardless of RBAC assignment. RBAC is default deny with explicit allow, whereas policy is default allow with explicit deny. Policy definitions, authored in JSON, implement policy by describing desired behavior for Azure resources when they are created or updated.

Azure Policy definition schema elements:
  - `mode`: which resources are 
    - `all`: both resource groups and all resources (default for policies defined in Portal)
    - `indexed`: only resource types that support tags and location (not all of them do)
  - `policyRule`: contains an object with two keys: `if` and `then`:
    - `if` block defines one or more conditions with logical operators
      - `field`: `type` represents type of resource being created based on the resource provider it belongs to
    - `then`: action to be taken
      - `effect` can have several values
        - `deny` generate an event in the activity log and fail the request
        - `audit` generate a warning event in the activity log but do not fail the request
        - `append` adds defined set of fields to the request
        - `auditifnotexists` enables auditing if a resource doesn't exist
        - `deployifnotexists` deploy a resource if it doesn't already exist
        - `disabled` don't evaluate resources for compliance to policy
      - `details`
  - `parameters`: make policy definitions reusable
    - name: i.e. `listOfAllowedSKUs`
      - `type` can be `string` or `array`
      - `metadata` is used by the Portal to display information for parameters; includes sub-properties `displayName`, `description`, and optionally `strongType`. `strongType` will produce a context menu of selections available populated by resources matching the value (i.e. if `vmSKUs` is the value it will produce a list of VMs when applying the policy)
      - `defaultValue`
      - `allowedValues`

To create a policy definition in Azure Portal, open __All Services__, then __Policy__, then the __Definitions__ blade. Both builtin and custom policies can be managed here.

Az CLI can be used to register the `Microsoft.PolicyInsights` resource provider is registered in the target subscription, a prerequisite for policy creation:
```bash
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.PolicyInsights'
```

Policy can then be created with the `az policy create` command
```bash
az policy definition create \
  --name 'allowedVMs' \
  --description 'Only allow virtual machines in the defined SKUs' 
  --mode ALL \
  --rules '{...}' \
  --params '{...}'
```

Policy can be applied to a scope using `az policy assignment create` command
```bash
az policy assignment create \
  --policy allowedVMs \
  --name 'deny-non-compliant-vms' \
  --scope '/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>' -p
```

Delete the policy assignment
```bash
az policy assignment delete \
  --name deny-non-compliant-vms
```

PowerShell commands:
  - `New-AzPolicyDefinition` add new definition
    - `-Name`
    - `-DisplayName`
    - `-Policy` takes the filename of the actual policy definition
  - `New-AzPolicyAssignment` make a policy assignment
    - `-Name`
    - `-DisplayName`
    - `-Scope`
    - `-PolicyDefinition`
    - `-PolicyParameter`
  - `Remove-AzPolicyAssignment` remove a policy assignment
    - `-Id`
  - `Remove-AzPolicyDefinition` remove a policy definition
    - `-Id`

## Skill 1.2: Analyze resource utilization
A robust monitoring strategy implementing proactive notifications helps to increase uptime and optimize performance. Azure offers __Azure Monitor__ and __Azure Advisor__.
  - __Azure Monitor__ provides a single point of contact for both metrics and logs. 
  - __Azure Advisor__ is a free, personalized guide to Azure best practices that provides recommendations to help you optimize resources.

Distinction between __metrics__ and __logs__:
  - Metrics are strictly numerical, while logs can be numerical or textual
  - Metrics are continuously collected, while log entries are less predictable

Azure Monitor can create __alert rules__ that are built on target resources or resource type and that proactively notify you of the health of resources and can also leverage action groups that automate actions to take in certain conditions.


### Configure diagnostic settings on resources
__Diagnostics logs__ are a type of log data that can be configured to send data to other locations, such as a Storage account or __Log Analytics__ workspace. Diagnostics logs have to be enabled for each resource to be monitored. Settings can be configured through Portal, ARM APIs, or the Azure Monitor REST APis

To enable diagnostics logs through Portal, browse to the resource itself. Alternatively, open __Azure Monitor__ and then the __Diagnostics Settings__ blade. From there you can view all eligible resouce types and view status of log collection.

__Azure Activity logs__ are another type of data that is surfaced at the subscription level, but lacks resource-level detail.

#### Enable diagnostics log collection with a storage account
```powershell
PS C:\> $resource = Get-AzResource `
>>   -Name <resourceName> `
>>   -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName>
PS C:\> $storage = Get-AzResource `
>>   -Name <resourceName> `
>>   -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName>
PS C:\> Set-AzDiagnosticSetting `
>>   -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId `
>>   -StorageAccountId $storage.ResourceId `
>>   -Enabled $true
```

```bash
$ az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
> --name <diagnosticName> \
> --storage-account <storageId> \
> --resource <resouceId> \
> --resouce-group <resourceGroup> \
> --logs '[ {
  "category": <categoryName>,
  "enabled": true,
  "retentionPolicy": {
    "days": <numberOfDays>,
    "enabled": true } } ] '
```

#### Enable diagnostics log streaming to an Event Hub
```powershell
PS C:\> $rule = Get-AzServiceBusRule -REsourceGroup <resourceGroupName> `
>> -Namespace <namespace> `
>> -Topic <topic> `
>> -Subscription <subscription> `
>> -Name <ruleName> 
PS C:\> Set-AzDiagnosticSetting `
>> -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId `
>> -ServiceBusRuleId $rule.Id `
>> -Enabled $true
```

```bash
$ az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
> --name <diagnosticName> \
> --event-hub-rule <eventHubRuleId> \
> --resource <targetResourceId> \
> --logs '[{
  "category": <categoryName>,
  "enabled": true }]'
```

#### Enable diagnostics logs collection in a Log Analytics workspace
```powershell
PS C:\> $workspace = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace `
>> -Name <workspaceName> `
>> -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> 
PS C:\> Set-AzDiagnosticSetting `
>> -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId `
>> -WorkspaceId $workspace.ResourceId `
>> -Enabled $true
```

```bash
$ az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
> --name <diagnosticName> \
> --workspace <logAnalyticsName> \
> --resource <resourceId> \
> --resouce-group <logAnalysticsWorkspaceResourceGroup> \
> --logs '[{
  "category": <categoryName>,
  "enabled": true }]'
```
