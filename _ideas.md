- Comprehensive software database that incorporates documentation for all languages.
  - Hierarchical and searchable menu of packages, objects, methods, etc
  - Each method expandable (like a Toggle List) with Tooltip-style explanation of data types, arguments, terms, etc, that are appropriate to the language context
  - Expandable, syntax-highlighted examples tagged by concepts and other syntax. If the example occurred in a stage of a tutorial, it can be navigated like a slider
  - Generated dynamically from markdown-like syntax
  - Star certain methods
  - Query by sequence of parameter data types (for learning)
  - compare syntax for similar work

## Products
Unix commands manual/concordance printed in a convenient trim (maybe 3.5" x 7"). Customizable, print-on-demand, containing only those commands needed by the user. Format should be similar to that of the Audobon Field Guides, which are very deliciously produced.
