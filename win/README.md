#### UWP
Universal Windows Platform provides a common app platform on every device that runs Windows 10, and UWP apps are primarily associated with the Microsoft Store. [^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform_apps "Wikipedia: \"Universal Windows Platform apps\"") [^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide "Microsoft Docs: \"What's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app?\"") UWP apps **adaptively** adjust UI elements to fit all Windows 10 devices. The **Fluent Design System** provides guidelines to provide a consistent and beautiful appearance to UWP apps. [^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/basics/design-and-ui-intro "Microsoft Docs: \"Introduction to UWP app design\"") Interesting new applications are not being developed on UWP, which does not bode well for the future of Windows as a consumer desktop computer platform.
