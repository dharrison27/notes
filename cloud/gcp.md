# Tasks
#### To-do application using MongoDB
Create two VMs, {backend} and {frontend}, running on Ubuntu. Make sure ports 80 and 22 are open.

#### Create a new Google Cloud Source Repository
These steps require:
  1. Cloud SDK and Git to be installed
  2. A GCP project with billing and the Cloud Source Repositories API enabled
Create a new repository [^](#sources)
```sh
gcloud source repos create hello-world
```
Clone it locally
```sh
gcloud source repos clone hello-world
```
Create scripts, then add, commit and push them as usual.
```sh
git commit -am "Initial"
git push origin master
```
#### Create a VM
[YouTube][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j274vq9a2Rs]
```sh
gcloud compute instances create instance-1 --zone-uscentral1-a
```
#### Functions
Deploy <sup>[Google][https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart]</sup>
```sh
gcloud functions deploy hello_get --runtime python37 --trigger-http
```
Test <sup>[Google][https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/creating-an-empty-repository]</sup>
```sh
gcloud functions describe hello_get
```
#### Change storage class
`$STORAGE_CLASS` can be `multi_regional`, `regional`, `nearline`, or `coldline`
```sh
gsutil rewrite -s $STORAGE_CLASS gs://$PATH_TO_OBJECT
```
