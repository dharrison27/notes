## 105.1 - Customize and use the shell environment

## 108.1 - Maintain system time (hardware clock, system clock, and NTP)
`date` display or set the time/date
`date +"%H"` display the current hours
`date +"%s"` display seconds of current epoch
`date MMDDHHmm` set date and time to MM/DD HH:mm; this causes a discrepancy with the hardware clock: "drift"
`hwclock` allows you to interface directly with the hardware clock, which is unaware of time zones
Two ways to synchronize these clocks:
  1. `hwclock --systohc` set the system clock to the hardware clock
  2. `hwclock --hctosys` set the hardware clock to the system clock
`ntpdate` : network time protocol, often not included by distros by default
`start ntpd` : start NTP daemon
/etc/ntp.conf : configures the pool of servers used to synchronize via NTP: `server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst`
`ntpq` : produces a special prompt that allows you to get more information on NTP servers
  - `peers` servers
  - `associations` information on servers in pool
`systemctl stop ntpd; ntpq; peers` this will produce a "read: Connection refused" error
## 108.2 - System logging
syslog daemon logs system messages according to log "levels", but modern distros typically use systemd's logging utility, `journalctl`
