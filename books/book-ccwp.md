# Cracking Codes With Python, by Al Sweigart

## 1. Making paper cryptography tools
_encryption_: making messages look indistinguishable from nonsense
_codes_: substituting messages with special symbols, typically available to the public
_cipher_: specific type of code meant to keep messages secret

### Caesar cipher
Substitution of every letter of the alphabet by shifting the entire alphabet. Coding each letter to a number would allow implementation of the Caesar cipher as simple addition of a value to to all the codes. Double encryption doesn't work.

## 2. Programming in the interactive shell
Basic mathematical operations

## 3. Strings and writing programs
