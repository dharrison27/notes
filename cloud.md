Classless Inter-Domain Domain Routing | style of describing IP address ranges where a slash followed by a number follows the IP address (i.e. `10.0.0.0/8`) describes what portion of an IP address is variable and what portion describes the host | [A](#sources): 280 
document store    | also "document-oriented database", a type of **NoSQL database** that relies on the concept of the record as **document**, whose **content** may differ in format and structure from document to document. Documents are placed within a **collection**, and each document is addressed via a unique key.

### Services
#### Firestore
Document-oriented database service intended for use in mobile and web applications that appears to have taken over from "FireBase Realtime Database" (ref. [B](#sources)).
  - **History**: Not to be confused with "Firebase Realtime Database", an earlier product that does not scale as well and does not offer as good an SLA (ref [H,I](#sources)). Graduated from beta in early 2019 (ref [I](#sources))
  - **Queries** (ref. [c](#sources))
    - Queries in Firestore are intended to be used to find documents stored in one specific collection or sub-collection. 
    - A query that spans multiple sub-collections ("collection group query") was not possible until recently, but the field has to be specified as having a scope of "Collection group" within GCP, and there is a limit of (about) 200 for these queries. 
    - An index is created for every field in every document added to a collection, which results in very fast query times that are proportional to the number of **results**, not records searched. But this means that there is no native way to perform wildcard searches or OR queries. For common instances of such queries, Google recommends adding a field that contains that result for each record 
    - Firestore's structure ensures that equality searches are highly performant.
    - "Inequality searches" present a challenge for Firestore. For some queries that combine conditions on more than one field (i.e. restaurants within a certain range of a location), Firebase will create a "composite index" (only within the index, the document itself is not affected) automatically to facilitate searches on those fields.
  - **Pricing**: Firestore primarily charges based on the number of reads, writes, and deletes performed on the database, each of which have a different unit charge. (ref [J](#sources))
#### BigTable
Realtime database used for Big Data (ref [G](#sources)).
  - **History**: BigTable evolved out of Google's need to ensure access to petabytes of data in its web search business line. It was described in a 2006 research paper that ended up launching the entire NoSQL industry. In 2015 it was made available as a service to cloud customers. (ref [D](#sources))
  - **Queries**: BigTable doesn't support secondary indexes (ref [E,F](#sources))
## Types of cloud services

  - **PaaS** ("paz") Platform as a Service 
  - **SaaS** ("saz") Software as a Service
