# BSD

## History
Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) began in the 70s and was based on AT&T original code. First source distributions required user to purchase a source license from AT&T, since much of the BSD source was derivative of UNIX
Berkeley finally released a "wholly-BSD" product as Network Release 1 in 1989, which satisfied vendor demand for the TCP/IP networking code for PC
Work immediately began to reconstruct the remaining functionality of UNIX, which was completed in Network Release 2, released in 1991, which was based entirely on Berkeley code. Eventually this resulted in the 386BSD distribution, which then spawned five interrelated BSD distros
  1. BSDI (now Wind River)
  2. NetBSD
  3. FreeBSD
  4. OpenBSD
  5. Darwin/Mac OS X

Unix System Laboratories (USL) sued BSDI after BSDI attempted to market its product as a real UNIX, and other BSD distributions were affected by disputed code. Ultimately 3 out of the 18,000 files that made up the Network Release 2 distribution were removed, which became known as 4.4BSD-lite, released in 1994. This legal dispute was partly to blame for Linux's rapid ascent in popularity.
