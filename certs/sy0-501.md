## Devices
Network devices [[1](#sources): 2-16]
- **Firewall** eliminates undesired access from the outside and can be composed of hardware, software, or both
- **Router** operates at OSI L3 and receives information from a host and forward it to its destination using tables which can be configured manually or dynamically, using one of a number of protocols. They can also use **access control lists (ACL)** to filter packets by source or destination address, protocol, or port.
- **Switch** operates at OSI L2 and forward packets from the **wiring closet** to the desktop.
- **Load balancer** server cluster to provide scalability and high availability by distributing IP traffic to multiple instances of a TCP/IP service, such as a web server.
- **Proxy** used for security, logging, and caching
- **Bastion host** exposed server that provides public access to a critical service (i.e. proxy, web, or email server), configured to isolate it from an organization's internal network [[1](#sources): 7]
- **Web security gateway** offers a single point of policy control and management for web-based content access [[1](#sources): 7]
- **VPN concentrator** allows multiple external users to access internal network resources securely
  - **Scalable Encryption Processing modules (SEP)** component of Cisco VPN concentrators [[1](#sources): 8]
- **Protocol analyzer** gather packet-level information across the network
- **UTM Security Appliance** (Barracuda Spam & Virus Firewall, Cisco Web Security)
- **Spam filter**
- **URL filter** report violations of content policies, and data can be filtered, captured, or blocked (Windows Parental Controls)
- **Content filter** needs to be trained to filter objectionable content
- **Malware inspection filter** web filter applied to HTTP traffic, inspecting the body of all HTTP requests and responses and blocking malicious content, hashing files and comparing values against a signature database, caching files for running a heuristic scan later
- **Web application firewall** also "deep packet inspection (DPI) firewalls", protects web servers against attack, used specifically for preventing common web-based attacks (i.e. cross-site scripting, SQL injection) [[1](#sourceS): 15]

#### IDS
**Intrustion Detection System (IDS)** designed to analyze data, identify attacks, and respond to intrusions and can use either **knowledge-** or **behavior-** based detection methods.\
Two types of IDS often used together:
- **Network IDS (NIDS)** monitor packet flow and try to locate packets that should not have gotten in; good at detecting **DoS attacks** and **unauthorized access**
- **Host IDS (HIDS)** monitor communications on each host and filter malicious data; good at detecting unauthorized **file modifications** and **user activity**

- **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** sits inline with traffic flow and prevents attacks in realtime. Sensors must be physically inline in order to function properly, creating a **single point of failure**; use of **fail-open** technology will allow the device to act as a patch cable if it fails.
- **Behavior-based** detection relies on comparing current with normal activity, identifying attempts to exploit new or undocumented vulnerabilities but also producing a high false alarm rate
- **Signature-based** detection relies on a database of known vulnerabilities
- **Anomaly-based** also relies on the concept of using a baseline of network behavior
