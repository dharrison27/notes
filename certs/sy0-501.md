## Secure network design
### Devices
Network devices [[1](#sources): 2-16]
- **Firewall** eliminates undesired access from the outside and can be composed of hardware, software, or both
- **Router** operates at OSI L3 and receives information from a host and forward it to its destination using tables which can be configured manually or dynamically, using one of a number of protocols. They can also use **access control lists (ACL)** to filter packets by source or destination address, protocol, or port.
- **Switch** operates at OSI L2 and forward packets from the **wiring closet** to the desktop.
- **Load balancer** server cluster to provide scalability and high availability by distributing IP traffic to multiple instances of a TCP/IP service, such as a web server.
- **Proxy** used for security, logging, and caching
- **Bastion host** exposed server that provides public access to a critical service (i.e. proxy, web, or email server), configured to isolate it from an organization's internal network [[1](#sources): 7]
- **Web security gateway** offers a single point of policy control and management for web-based content access [[1](#sources): 7]
- **VPN concentrator** allows multiple external users to access internal network resources securely
  - **Scalable Encryption Processing modules (SEP)** component of Cisco VPN concentrators [[1](#sources): 8]
- **Protocol analyzer** gather packet-level information across the network
- **UTM Security Appliance** (Barracuda Spam & Virus Firewall, Cisco Web Security)
- **Spam filter**
- **URL filter** report violations of content policies, and data can be filtered, captured, or blocked (Windows Parental Controls)
- **Content filter** needs to be trained to filter objectionable content
- **Malware inspection filter** web filter applied to HTTP traffic, inspecting the body of all HTTP requests and responses and blocking malicious content, hashing files and comparing values against a signature database, caching files for running a heuristic scan later
- **Web application firewall** also "deep packet inspection (DPI) firewalls", protects web servers against attack, used specifically for preventing common web-based attacks (i.e. cross-site scripting, SQL injection) [[1](#sourceS): 15]

#### IDS
**Intrustion Detection System (IDS)** designed to analyze data, identify attacks, and respond to intrusions and can use either **knowledge-** or **behavior-** based detection methods.\
Two types of IDS often used together:
- **Network IDS (NIDS)** monitor packet flow and try to locate packets that should not have gotten in; good at detecting **DoS attacks** and **unauthorized access**
- **Host IDS (HIDS)** monitor communications on each host and filter malicious data; good at detecting unauthorized **file modifications** and **user activity**

- **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** sits inline with traffic flow and prevents attacks in realtime. Sensors must be physically inline in order to function properly, creating a **single point of failure**; use of **fail-open** technology will allow the device to act as a patch cable if it fails.
- **Behavior-based** detection relies on comparing current with normal activity, identifying attempts to exploit new or undocumented vulnerabilities but also producing a high false alarm rate
- **Signature-based** detection relies on a database of known vulnerabilities
- **Anomaly-based** also relies on the concept of using a baseline of network behavior

Firewall rules [[Barrett](#sources): 20-1]
- Specify one of three actions: allow, allow if secured, or block
- More restrictive rules should be specified first, since processing stops when a rule is found for a network packet

### Network administration
- **Rule-based access control (RBAC)** based on ACLs
- **Firewall rules** allow traffic associated with programs or services to be sent or received adn can take one of three actions: **allow** the connection, **allow if secured**, or **block** it. More restrictive rules should be listed first, since as soon as a rule matching the network packet is found the rule is implemented and further rules are not consulted. [[Barrett](#sources): 20-1]
- **VLAN management**
- **Access control** process of making resources available to accounts that should have access. Most common privileges are **read**, **write**, **delete**, and **execute**.
  - **Access control entry (ACE)** components of an ACL in Microsoft operating systems [[Barrett](#sources): 23]
- **Port security** traffic control feature on Cisco Catalyst switches whereby an individual switch port can be configured to only allow traffic from specific MAC addresses. [[Barrett](#sources): 23]
  - **Shutdown mode** default behavior of an interface using port security, whereby it enters the error-disabled state [[Barrett](#sources): 23]
  - **Protect mode** frames from MAC addresses other than the allowed addresses are dropped [[Barrett](#sources): 23]
  - **Restrict mode** frames from MAC addresses other than the allowed addresses are dropped, syslog message is generated, and violation counter is increased [[Barrett](#sources): 23]
- **802.1X** passes EAP over a wired or wireless LAN, used for access control especially for wireless APs [[Barrett](#sources): 24]
- **Flood guard** advanced firewall guard feature used to control network activity associated with DoS attacks, most commonly associated with the Cisco PIX firewall [[Barrett](#sources): 24]
- Loop protection through STP
- **Implicit deny** resource availability is restricted to only those logins explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even when not explicitly denied access [[Barrett](#sources): 25]
- Network separation reduces the potential for damage in interconnected systems
- **Logging** process of collecting data to be used for monitoring and auditing purposes [[Barrett](#sources): 26]
- **Unified threat management (UTM)** appliance that integrates a wide range of security features, combining the functions of firewall, gateway antivirus, IDS, VPN, and endpoint control, and providing better incident awareness, security control, network traffic notification, and monitoring of user behavior and application content than individual devices [[Barrett](#sources): 27]

### Network design elements
- DMZ
- Subnetting: most commonly done to control network traffic by limiting broadcasts. Subnet divisions can reflect organizational structure and security policy objectives. [[Barret](#sources): 32]
  - **Intranet** subnet portion of the internal network that uses web-based technologies 
  - **Extranet** subnet of the public infrastructure that allows resources to be used by authorized partners; commonly used for B2B relationships
- **VLAN** unites network nodes into the same broadcast domain regardless of physical attachment, limiting broadcast traffic [[Barret](#sources): 35]
  - **Frame tagging** 802.1Q process where frames are encapsulated with headers and tagged with a VLAN ID which informs forwarding decisions by VLAN-aware network devices
- NAT
  - **Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)** use of one device with access to the Internet as an access point for other devices to connect [[Dulaney](#sources): 480, [Barrett](#sources): 36]
  - **Network address translation - protocol translation (NAT-PT)** developed as a means for hosts that run IPv6 to communicate with hosts that run IPv4 [[Barret](#sources): 36]
- **Remote access service (RAS)** allows secure access to corporate resources through an encrypted tunnel over the Internet; achieved primarily through VPNs using IPsec or SSL [[Dulaney](#sources): 348; [Barrett](#sources): 37]
  - **Routing and remote access (RRAS)** network service available on Microsoft server installations that allows the deployment of VPNs and dialup RAS

**Telephony** transmission of data through equipment in a telecommunications environment, including voice, fax, or other data [[Barret](#sources): 37-8]
- **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)** application layer protocol used to create multimedia sessions, including VoIP, using default ports **5060** and **5061**; commonly used in instant messaging but can also be used as an alternative to VoIP [[Dulaney](#sources): 57; [Barrett](#sources): 38]
- **Inter asterisk exchange (IAX)** audio/video protocol
- **Private branch exchange (PBX)** 
- VoIP
- H.323

**Network access control (NAC)** grants or denies access to a machine according to its configuration [[Barret](#sources): 39-40]\
Components:
- **Access requestor (AR)** device requesting access; assessment can be self-performed or delegated to another system
- **Policy decision point (PDP)** system that assigns a policy based on the assessment
- **Policy enforcement point (PEP)** device that enforces policy (switch, firewall, or router) 

Integrating NAC systems into a network:
- **Inline** appliance between access and distribution switches
- **Out of band** intervenes and performs assessment as hosts come online and then grants appropriate access
- **Switch based** enforcement occurs on switch
- **Host based** host agent assess and enforces access policy

Security concepts
- **Layered security** security should be implemented at different layers to form a complete security strategy [[Barret](#sources): 44]
- **Defense in depth** emphasis should be balanced between people, technology and operations; layered security components slow down threats, giving organization time to respond [[Barret](#sources): 44]

## Network implementation

### Protocols
#### TLS
**Transport Layer Security (TLS)** asymmetric key encapsulation considered the successor to SSL; based on Netscape's SSL3 transport protocol [[Dulaney](#sources): 345-6, 503; [Barrett](#sources): 55]
- **TLS Record Protocol** allows client and server to communicate using some form of encryption algorithm, or without one entirely
- **TLS Handshake Protocol** allows client and server to authenticate one another and exchange encryption keys to be used during the session

#### DNS
- **Authoritative server** definitive for particular domains, providing information about only those domains [[Barrett](#sources): 54]
- **Caching server** resolves a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain [[Barrett](#sources): 54]

#### IPsec
**Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)** authentication and encapsulation standard widely used to establish secure VPN communications, working at OSI L3 by supporting the IKE protocol [[Dulaney](#sources): 345, 483; [Barrett](#sources): 51]\
Two primary security services:
- **Authentication Header (AH)** provides authentication of data sender and integrity checking for data packets
- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)** supports authentication of the data's sender and encryption of data being transfered

#### SNMP
SNMP management infrastructure components: [[Barrett](#sources): 52-53]
- SNMP managed node
- SNMP agent collects the information and forwards it to the management station
- SNMP management station collect massive amounts of critical network information and are targets of attack. SNMPv2 uses MD5 for authentication.

**SNMPv3** protection levels can be configured on a transaction-by-transaction basis:
- **AuthPriv** offers HMAC with MD5 or SHA authentication and CBC DES encryption 
- **AuthNoPriv** provides authorization using HMAC with MD5 or SHA, but with no encryption 
- **NoAuthNoPriv** uses community strings for authorization and does not use encryption  

#### SSH
Uses IDEA [cipher](#cryptography) by default, but Blowfish, DES, and 3DES are also available. [[Barrett](#sources): 54]

## Cryptography
Ciphers
- **Block** ciphers
  - **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** Feistel cipher with a 64-bit block size and 56-bit key [[Barrett](#sources): 54; [A](#sources)]
  - **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** symmetric-key cyptographic algorithm  using a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits; developed by two Belgian cryptographers as a submission to NIST for a competition to replace **DES** [[Dulaney](#sources): 463; [A](#sources)]
  - **Blowfish** symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that uses a 16-round Feistel cipher with a 64-bit block and a variable key length up to 448 bits [[Barrett](#sources): 54; [A](#sources)]
  - **Twofish** symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that uses a 128-bit block size with a maximum key size of 128 bits; co-developed by the author of **Blowfish**; lost the competition to replace DES [[A](#sources)]
- **Stream** ciphers generate a one-time pad for encryption and must use a random keystream

Block cipher **modes of operation** encryption of messages with sizes different from that of the block length [[A](#sources)]
- **Electronic Code Book (ECB)** simplest block cipher mode of operation where each block of plaintext is encrypted separately
- **Cipher Block Chaining  (CBC)** an initialization vector using a random public value is XORed with the plaintext prior to encryption for the first round; subsequent rounds use the ciphertext of the previous round
- **Cipher Feedback (CFB)** an initialization vector is encrypted and the result is XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext of the block; first block is a random value and other blocks use the previous block's ciphertext
- **Counter mode (CTR)** every encryption operation is separate but uses a **nonce** and a counter; plaintext is XORed with the output of the encryption operation to produce ciphertext
  - **Nonce** random number used for all blocks of an encryption operation
- **Galois Counter Mode (GCM)** special case of CTR that doesn't use a nonce but relies only on a counter and calculates a **MAC**
  - **Message authentication code (MAC)** provides a means for ensuring that a message was not tampered with en route

#### WLAN
**WPA modes**
- **WPA-Personal Shared Key (WPA-PSK)** passphrase consisting of 8-63 ASCII characters is all that is required to gain access 
- **WPA-802.1X** also "WPA-RADIUS" or "WPA-Enterprise", requires the use of security certificates for access 

**WPA2 modes**
- **WPA2-Personal (WPA2-PSK)** uses a pre-shared key (PSK) of 64 hexadecimal digits or a passphrase of 8 to 63 ASCII characters [[Barrett](#sources): 71]
- **WPA2-Enterprise** verifies network users through a server [[Barrett](#sources): 71]

WLAN encryption
- **Counter-mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)** encryption algorithm used by WPA2, using 128-bit AES encryption with a 48-bit initialization vector; based on AES and superceding TKIP [[Dulaney](#sources): 374; [Barrett](#sources): 72]
- **Temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP)** inferior encryption algorithm used by WPA [[Dulaney](#sources): 374, 502]
- **RC4** flawed stream cipher used by WEP using a shared secret key to generate a long sequence of bytes from a generator 



## Certificates
- **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)** certificate allows multiple domains to be protected 
- **Wildcard certificate** allows for unlimited subdomains of the same domcd ain to be protected 
- **Self-signed certificate** cannot be used across multiple domains and does not support external users; used during initial testing only 
- **Root certificate** resides on the root CA within a PKI hierarchy and is the source from which any other certificates issued inherit their authority 

## Risk
IDS controls [[Barrett](#sources): 86]
- **False positive** control that mistakenly refuses authorized access, falsely identifying the access as invalid
- **False negative** control that mistakenly allows unauthorized access, falsely identifying the access as valid

Risk management strategies [[Barrett](#sources): 96]
- **Avoidance** elimination of the vulnerability that gives rise to a particular risk
- **Transference** moving risk of exposure to hosted providers who assume the responsibility for recovery and restoration or insurance to cover cost of equipment theft or data exposure
- **Acceptance** accepting a risk as sufficiently unlikely or of such limited impact that corrective controls are not necessary
- **Mitigation** reducing likelihood or impact of a risk's exposure

#### Attacks
DoS attacks [[Barrett](#sources): 218]
- **Teardrop** sends fragmented UDP packets with odd offset values, causing them to overwrite each other when the operating system rebuilds them, which then crashes
- **Bonk** sends corrupt UDP packets to port 53
  - **Boink** bonk attack that targets multiple ports, rather than just 53
- **Christmas tree** packet that makes use of each option for the underlying protocol 

#### Risk assessment
- **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)** length of time a device is expected to last in operation [[Barrett](#sources): 93]
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** predicted time between inherent failures of a system, like hardware components [[Dulaney](#sources): 488; [Barrett](#sources): 93]
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)** average time that a device will take to recover from a failure [[Dulaney](#sources): 315; [Barrett](#sources): 93]

  - **Single loss expectancy (SLE)** expected loss every time a risk occurs [[Barrett](#sources): 91]
  - **Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)** estimated possibility of a specific threat taking place in one year [[Barrett](#sources): 92]

#### Control
Control types
- **Technical controls** also "logical controls", security controls put in place to prevent unauthorized access, including logical access control systems, security systems, encryption, and data classification [[Barrett](#sources): 85, 170]
- **Administrative controls** also "management controls", business and organizational processes and procedures and administrative controls, such as security policies and procedures, personnel background checks, security awareness training, and formal change-management procedures [[Barrett](#sources): 85, 170]

- **Deterrent controls** intended to discourage violation of policies or procedures, usually taking the form of punishment or negative consequence [[Barrett](#sources): 169]
- **Preventive controls** avoid the occurrence of unwanted events by inhibiting the free use of computing resources [[Barrett](#sources): 169]
- **Detective controls** identify when violations have occurred [[Barrett](#sources): 169]
- **Compensating controls** reduce the risk of weakness in an existing control [[Barrett](#sources): 169]

#### Personnel management
- **Privacy policy** needs to be in compliance with state and federal laws related to privacy protection, like the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** [[Barrett](#sources): 87]
- **Acceptable use policy** must provide users the least possible access while still allowing them to fulfill work tasks
