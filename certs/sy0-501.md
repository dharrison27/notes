- **Bonk** sends corrupt UDP packets to port 53
  - **Boink** bonk attack that targets multiple ports, rather than just 53
- **Christmas tree** packet that makes use of each option for the underlying protocol 
## Technologies
#### Devices
Network devices [[Barrett][Barrett]: 2-16]
- **Firewall** eliminates undesired access from the outside and can be composed of hardware, software, or both
- **Router** operates at OSI L3 and receives information from a host and forward it to its destination using tables which can be configured manually or dynamically, using one of a number of protocols. They can also use **access control lists (ACL)** to filter packets by source or destination address, protocol, or port.
- **Switch** operates at OSI L2 and forward packets from the **wiring closet** to the desktop.
- **Load balancer** server cluster to provide scalability and high availability by distributing IP traffic to multiple instances of a TCP/IP service, such as a web server.
- **Proxy** used for security, logging, and caching
- **Bastion host** exposed server that provides public access to a critical service (i.e. proxy, web, or email server), configured to isolate it from an organization's internal network [[Barrett][Barrett]: 7]
- **Web security gateway** offers a single point of policy control and management for web-based content access [[Barrett][Barrett]: 7]

- **Web application firewall** also "deep packet inspection (DPI) firewalls", protects web servers against attack, used specifically for preventing common web-based attacks (i.e. cross-site scripting, SQL injection) [[Barrett][Barrett]: 15]
#### IDS
**Intrustion Detection System (IDS)** designed to analyze data, identify attacks, and respond to intrusions and can use either **knowledge-** or **behavior-** based detection methods.\
Two types of IDS often used together:
- **Network IDS (NIDS)** monitor packet flow and try to locate packets that should not have gotten in; good at detecting **DoS attacks** and **unauthorized access**
- **Host IDS (HIDS)** monitor communications on each host and filter malicious data; good at detecting unauthorized **file modifications** and **user activity**

- **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)** sits inline with traffic flow and prevents attacks in realtime. Sensors must be physically inline in order to function properly, creating a **single point of failure**; use of **fail-open** technology will allow the device to act as a patch cable if it fails.
- **Behavior-based** detection relies on comparing current with normal activity, identifying attempts to exploit new or undocumented vulnerabilities but also producing a high false alarm rate
- **Signature-based** detection relies on a database of known vulnerabilities
- **Anomaly-based** also relies on the concept of using a baseline of network behavior

Firewall rules [[Barrett][Barrett]: 20-1]
- Specify one of three actions: allow, allow if secured, or block
- More restrictive rules should be specified first, since processing stops when a rule is found for a network packet
### Network administration
- **Rule-based access control (RBAC)** based on ACLs
- **Firewall rules** allow traffic associated with programs or services to be sent or received adn can take one of three actions: **allow** the connection, **allow if secured**, or **block** it. More restrictive rules should be listed first, since as soon as a rule matching the network packet is found the rule is implemented and further rules are not consulted. [[Barrett][Barrett]: 20-1]
- **VLAN management**
- **Access control** process of making resources available to accounts that should have access. Most common privileges are **read**, **write**, **delete**, and **execute**.
  - **Access control entry (ACE)** components of an ACL in Microsoft operating systems [[Barrett][Barrett]: 23]
- **Port security** traffic control feature on Cisco Catalyst switches whereby an individual switch port can be configured to only allow traffic from specific MAC addresses. [[Barrett][Barrett]: 23]
  - **Shutdown mode** default behavior of an interface using port security, whereby it enters the error-disabled state [[Barrett][Barrett]: 23]
  - **Protect mode** frames from MAC addresses other than the allowed addresses are dropped [[Barrett][Barrett]: 23]
  - **Restrict mode** frames from MAC addresses other than the allowed addresses are dropped, syslog message is generated, and violation counter is increased [[Barrett][Barrett]: 23]
- **802.1X** passes EAP over a wired or wireless LAN, used for access control especially for wireless APs [[Barrett][Barrett]: 24]

- Network separation reduces the potential for damage in interconnected systems
- **Logging** process of collecting data to be used for monitoring and auditing purposes [[Barrett][Barrett]: 26]
- **Unified threat management (UTM)** appliance that integrates a wide range of security features, combining the functions of firewall, gateway antivirus, IDS, VPN, and endpoint control, and providing better incident awareness, security control, network traffic notification, and monitoring of user behavior and application content than individual devices [[Barrett][Barrett]: 27]

#### Network design elements

Security concepts
- **Layered security** security should be implemented at different layers to form a complete security strategy [[Barret](#sources): 44]
- **Defense in depth** emphasis should be balanced between people, technology and operations; layered security components slow down threats, giving organization time to respond [[Barret](#sources): 44]

#### NAC
**Network access control (NAC)** grants or denies access to a machine according to its configuration [[Barret](#sources): 39-40]\
Components:
- **Access requestor (AR)** device requesting access; assessment can be self-performed or delegated to another system
- **Policy decision point (PDP)** system that assigns a policy based on the assessment
- **Policy enforcement point (PEP)** device that enforces policy (switch, firewall, or router) 

Integrating NAC systems into a network:
- **Inline** appliance between access and distribution switches
- **Out of band** intervenes and performs assessment as hosts come online and then grants appropriate access
- **Switch based** enforcement occurs on switch
- **Host based** host agent assess and enforces access policy

#### TLS
**Transport Layer Security (TLS)** asymmetric key encapsulation considered the successor to SSL; based on Netscape's SSL3 transport protocol [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 345-6, 503; [Barrett][Barrett]: 55]
- **TLS Record Protocol** allows client and server to communicate using some form of encryption algorithm, or without one entirely
- **TLS Handshake Protocol** allows client and server to authenticate one another and exchange encryption keys to be used during the session

#### DNS

- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)** supports authentication of the data's sender and encryption of data being transfered

#### SNMP
SNMP management infrastructure components: [[Barrett][Barrett]: 52-53]
- SNMP managed node
- SNMP agent collects the information and forwards it to the management station
- SNMP management station collect massive amounts of critical network information and are targets of attack. SNMPv2 uses MD5 for authentication.

**SNMPv3** protection levels can be configured on a transaction-by-transaction basis:
- **AuthPriv** offers HMAC with MD5 or SHA authentication and CBC DES encryption 
- **AuthNoPriv** provides authorization using HMAC with MD5 or SHA, but with no encryption 
- **NoAuthNoPriv** uses community strings for authorization and does not use encryption

- **At-rest** data stored in persistent storage

### Symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography

- **Asymmetric key cryptography** also "public key algorithm", each user has a pair of keys: a public one used to encrypt the message and a private one used to decrypt it [[Barrett][Barrett]: 442]

Symmetric methods of encryption [[Barrett][Barrett]: 444]
- **Block** ciphers encrypt plain text in fixed-length groups of bits or **blocks**

#### Asymmetric algorithms
- **Rivest, Shamir, Adelman (RSA)** asymmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that can use a key of any length and which was released into the public domain in 2000; works by multiplying two large prime numbers and derives a set of numbers through other operations [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 496; [Barrett][Barrett]: 461]
  - **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)** developed by the NSA in 1991 as an alternative to RSA which is faster in signing but slower in verifying, thus preferable if there are performance issues on the client [[B][B]]
- **Diffie-Hellman key exchange (D-H)** also "exponential key agreement", an early asymmetric-key cryptographic algorithm, vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. [[Barrett][Barrett]: 461]
It was the first prime-number algorithm and patented in 1977. Requires sharing of an arbitrary number which is multiplied by a secret number selected by each party. Both parties exchange the product, which is then multiplied by their own secret number which should produce the same result.[B]
- **Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)** asymmetric key encryption algorithm based on complex mathematical structures; it uses smaller key sizes than traditional public-key cryptosystems and is therefore faster and less resource-intensive than traditional system [[Barrett][Barrett]: 444, 461]

- **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** obsolete symmetric-key block cipher cryptographic algorithm superceded by AES; uses a random key selected from a large number of shared keys; most forms are export-controlled; Feistel cipher with a 64-bit block size and 56-bit key; adopted for use by NIST in 1977 [[Barrett][Barrett]: 54, 459; [A][A]]
- **Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)** symmetric key encryption algorithm that uses DES three times with three different keys, providing a total bit strength of 168 bits [[Barrett][Barrett]: 54, 459]
- **Rivest Cipher (RC2, RC5, RC6)** family of interrelated symmetric-key block ciphers [[Barrett][Barrett]: 459]
  - **RC4** flawed stream cipher used by WEP using a shared secret key to generate a long sequence of bytes from a generator

  - **Blowfish Encryption Algorithm** symmetric-key block cipher that uses a 16-round Feistel cipher with a 64-bit block and a variable key length up to 448 bits [[Barrett][Barrett]: 54, 459; [A][A]]

#### Cipher modes
Block cipher **modes of operation** encryption of messages with sizes different from that of the block length [[A][A]]
- **Cipher Block Chaining  (CBC)** an initialization vector using a random public value is XORed with the plaintext prior to encryption for the first round; subsequent rounds use the ciphertext of the previous round
- **Galois Counter Mode (GCM)** special case of CTR that doesn't use a nonce but relies only on a counter and calculates a **MAC**
- **Electronic Code Book (ECB)** simplest block cipher mode of operation where each block of plaintext is encrypted separately
- **Cipher Feedback (CFB)** an initialization vector is encrypted and the result is XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext of the block; first block is a random value and other blocks use the previous block's ciphertext
- **Counter mode (CTR)** every encryption operation is separate but uses a **nonce** and a counter; plaintext is XORed with the output of the encryption operation to produce ciphertext
  - **Nonce** random number used for all blocks of an encryption operation
  - **Message authentication code (MAC)** provides a means for ensuring that a message was not tampered with en route

#### Key stretching algorithms
**Key stretching** makes an existing key or password stronger by performing a function to increase the time it might otherwise take to crack it by brute force; takes the original key and feeds it through an algorithm which results in a stronger key [[Barrett][Barrett]: 468]
- **Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)** applies a pseudorandom function to the password, combined with a salt of at least 64 bits, repeating the process at least 1,000 times

- **RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD)** less commonly used hash algorithm; RIPEMD-160 is comparable to SHA-1

**Message authentication code (MAC)** also "authentication tag", derived by applying a applying a message or file combined with a secret key to a cryptographic algorithm; basically an encrypted hash [[Barrett][Barrett]: 450]

- **Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP)** obsolete reversible encryption protocol that encrypts password data sent between client and server

#### Forward secrecy
**Perfect forward secrecy** process of destroying **session keys** after communication session is complete. A **session key** also "symmetric key", is a randomly generated key to perform both encryption and decryption during a session [[Barrett][Barrett]: 445-6]\

#### Key management
- **Centralized key management** allows issuing authority to have complete control over the process [[Barrett][Barrett]: 484]
- **Decentralized key management** allows requesting entity to generate the key pair and only submit the public key to the CA, which can still distribute and publish the digital certificate but no longer store the private key

- **Authentication** process of validating an identity [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 462]; [Barrett][Barrett]: 402; [Neil][Neil]: 13]
- **Authorization** identifying the resources a user can access after authentication; mechanism by which a system grants or revokes the right to access some resource or perform some action [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 462]; [Barrett][Barrett]: 402; [Neil][Neil]: 13]

- **Federation** assigning an administrative account capable of enumerating local security principals and resources, with the federation system accessible from each domain, allowing accounts in one domain access to resources in other communicating domains [[Barrett][Barrett]: 416-7]
- **Trust** interoperation assigned directly between two resource pools through administrative actions within each specifically designating the other as a trusted resource pool and allowing enumeration of accounts and available resources, so that access control over any resource can be granted or denied to any account in either domain [[Barrett][Barrett]: 417]
  - **Transitive trust** trust that can extend beyond two domains to other trusted domains in the forest [[Barrett][Barrett]: 417; [D][D]]
#### CHAP
**Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)** protocol that challenges a system to verify identity at random intervals by requiring client to send a MD5 hash value back to the service (called the **authenticator**) which verifies the value; improvement on PAP and functions over PPP [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 170, 468; [Barrett][Barrett]: 411, 458]
  - **Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)** simple but insecure PPP authentication protocol providing one-way authentication while sending credentials in cleartext, typically used only with older Unix systems that do not support more secure authentication protocols [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 491; [Barrett][Barrett]: 411]

- **Least privilege** access control practice wherein a logon is provided only the bare minimum access to resources required to perform its tasks [[Barrett][Barrett]: 402; [Neil][Neil]: 14]
- **Separation of duties** access control practice involving both the separation of logons (user account separate from admin account, even if both belong to the same network admin) and the separation of roles (prevents the same individual from being able to verify or record the success or failure of their own work) [[Barrett][Barrett]: 403]
- **Implicit deny** access control practice where resource availability is restricted to only those logins explicitly granted access, remaining unavailable even when not explicitly denied access [[Barrett][Barrett]: 25, 412]

- **Access Control List (ACL)** mechanism for authorizing privileges for accounts; list of trustees assigned to a file or directory, or permitted computers or users in the context of routers or firewalls [[Dulaney][Dulaney]: 462; [Barrett][Barrett]: 403]

  - **Subject** attributes describe user attempting access
  - **Action** attributes describe action being attempted
  - **Object** attributes describe resource being accessed
  - **Contextual** attributes describe dynamic environmental factors of access

- **Mutual authentication** both client and server verify that the computer with which they are communicating is the proper system
One system creates a challenge code based on a random number, which is sent to the other. The receiving system generates a response code using the challenge code, then creates a challenge code of its own, sending both to the originating system. The originator verifies the response and returns its own response to the challenge code of the second system. Once the second system has verified this last response code, it notifies the originating system and both systems consider themselves mutually authenticated.  [[Barrett][Barrett]: 396-7]

#### Biometrics

#### Authentication miscellany
- **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** XML framework for creating and exchanging security information that relies on assertions about identities and needs to use timed sessions [[Barrett][Barrett]: 398]
- **Service oriented architecture (SOA)** environment in which the client-facing proxy application provides a standard mechanism or "wrapper" for handling specialized logon, authentication, and access control functions [[Barrett][Barrett]: 412]

Formal security criteria [[Barrett][Barrett]: 405]
- **Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)** referred to as the "Orange Book", identifies 4 levels of security based on the minimum access control used 
- **Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC)**

- **Explicit mode** client will be able to request encryption [[^][measureup]]

#### Data governance
A data [owner](#data-governance "senior person accountable for quality of a dataset but who delegates day-to-day activites") delegates responsibility to the data [steward](#data-governance "owns business accountability for dataset") and [custodian](#data-governance "owns technical accountability for a dataset") for business and technical activites, respectively.
