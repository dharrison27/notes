## Roles

A **role** is the primary task assigned to a server. You add them to a server using **Server Manager** through the **Add Roles and Features** wizard, and they come at no additional cost.  **Role Services** augment the functionality of installed roles. **Features** are also available from within the **Add Roles and Features** wizard

Windows Server role or feature       | Description       | Role Services | Source

#### Application servers
**Application servers** are individual Microsoft products that require their own licenses.

Application Servers   | Product               | Description
---                   | ---                   | ---
Mail server           | Exchange Server       | Protocols: POP3, IMAP, SMTP
Database server       | Microsoft SQL Server  | Protocols: Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Object Linking and Embedding Database (OLEDB)
Collaboration server  | Sharepoint Server     | 
Monitoring server     | System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) | Deploy, configure, manage, and monitor operations, services, devices, and applications of enterprise systems through a single console
Threat management     | System Center 2016 Endpoint Protection, also Forefront Threat Management Gateway (Forefront TMG), foremerly Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server; network router, firewall, VPN server, and web cache

## Storage
### External Storage
**Fibre Channel** is an alternative to **SCSI**, especially if the storage will be physically separated from the server. The maximum range of SCSI is 12 meters, but Fibre Channel is more expensive.
### Network Storage
- **SAN** uses block-level storage, appearing as disk drives to clients. A SAN configured using Fibre Channel is a separate network from any LAN, and devices using SAN storage must have a FC adapter.
- **NAS** provides access through file sharing, acting as a network-based file server.

### NTFS

NTFS permission | Description 
---             | ---
Full control    | allow reading, writing, modifying, executing, changing attributes and permissions, and deleting files and subfolders 
Modify          | reading, modifying, adding, and deleting files and subfolders
List folder contents  | viewing data files and list of folder's content
Read | viewing file and file properties
Read and Execute| running and executing files
Write
Special permissions

Share permissions
- Full control
- Change
- Read

## Installation
#### Editions
Windows Server 2012 R2
- **Datacenter**: up to 64 processors including fault-tolerance features with unlimited amount of virtual machines
- **Standard** (previously **Enterprise**): for non-virtualized or lightly virtualized environments
- **Essentials**: limited to 1 physical or virtual server; lacks Core, Hyper-V, and Active Directory Federation Services
- **Foundation**: only basic server features, such as file and print services with no virtualization rights

Windows Server 2016
- **Datacenter**: up to 512 cores, 24TB RAM; unlimited VMs
- **Standard**: up to 512 cores, 24 TB RAM; 2 VMs
- **Essentials**: 2 CPUs, 64 GB RAM, no virtualization

#### Installation options
- **Desktop Experience** (GUI)
- **Server Core** managed locally through Windows PowerShell or remotely through Server Manager. Starting with the 2016 edition, there is no longer an option to switch between interfaces. If **Desktop Experience** was installed by mistake, the **Windows Installer** has to be used to switch to the **Core** interface.
- **Nano Server**: replacement for Server Core that takes up even less hardware resources with no local login capabilities

#### Requirements

--        | Desktop Experience  | Server Core
:---      | :---                | :---
RAM       | 2 GB                | 512 MB
Processor | 1.4 GHz 64-bit      | same
Space     | 32 GB               | same

#### Upgrading
Windows Server 2012 R2 **Standard** upgradeable to:
- Windows Server 2016 **Standard**
- Windows Server 2016 **Datacenter**

Windows Server 2012 R2 **Datacenter** upgradeable to:
- Windows Server 2016 **Datacenter**

Windows Server 2012 [R2] **Essentials** upgradeable to:
- Windows Server 2016 **Essentials**

Windows Server 2012 [R2] **Workgroup**  upgradeable to:
- Windows Server 2016 **Workgroup**

**Nano Server** is new for 2016, so there is no upgrade path from 2012.


## Drivers
By default, Windows 8.1 and 10 do not accept unsigned drivers, so testing unsigned drivers on these clients requires **Test Signing Mode** to be turned on (using Advanced Startup Options or [`bcdedit`](../win/cmd.md#bcdedit))

#### Windows Update
Group Policy should be used to prevent certain updates from being done automatically. This includes clients in a local workgroup as well as Active Directory.

## Services
[`services.msc`](#mmc "\"Service Manager\", MMC snap-in that allows you to stop or start Windows services")

Three predefined local accounts used by the Service Control Manager, in order of increasing privilege:
- **LocalService**, meant to run least-privileged services, accesses the network as an _Anonymous_ user
- **NetworkService**, meant to run standard privileged services with the right to access the network as the machine by presenting the computer's credentials to remote servers
- **LocalSystem**, completely trusted account, even more so than the administrator account.

**Managed Service Accounts** and **Group Managed Service Accounts** provide an alternative means of providing security context to services.

## Active Directory
- **Groups** are designed to grant access to data
- **Organizational Units** are designed to delegate administration

### Groups
A **group** is a collection of **Active Directory objects**, understood as representing users, computers, peripheral devices, and network services. A **Group Policy** is the best option offered by Microsoft to set up restrictions on computers and users, and can be understood as templates that enable sysadmins to control what users can and cannot do on AD objects. **Group Policy Objects (GPO)** are collections of configured parameters that show how computers will look and behave for a certain group of users.

GPOs are assigned in the following order: Local, Site, Domain, OU

GPOs assigned to **computer accounts** take effect when the computers are turned on, but those assigned to **user accounts** take effect upon login.

2 types of group:
- **Security** groups are explicitly used to assign permissions to shared resources on a network
- **Distribution** groups are used exclusively for email

3 group **scopes**:
- **Domain local** groups include accounts, other domain local groups, global groups, and universal groups from the parent's domain local group domain. These evolved from the old **Local groups**, which are no longer available, but used to be visible only to domain controllers when they were local to them. Domain local groups are visible to all workstations and servers joined to the AD domain. [techgenix.com](http://techgenix.com/back-basics-groups-vs-organizational-units-active-directory/)
- **Global** groups include accounts and other global groups from the parent's global group domain
- **Universal** groups include accounts, global groups, and universal groups from **any** domain in the forest where a universal group belongs. These are designed to cross domain boundaries, such that a universal group could be seen and used by all domains in a forest.

#### Usage of groups
> In the end, the new model for the usage of groups in Active Directory is the following: users are to be placed into global groups, global groups are to be placed into domain local groups, and the domain local groups are to be placed on the access control lists of the data stored on the servers. If there are multiple domains and universal groups are desired, then the global groups containing users are to be placed into universal groups. The universal groups are then placed into the domain local groups, where the domain local groups are then placed on the access control lists. [techgenix.com](http://techgenix.com/back-basics-groups-vs-organizational-units-active-directory/)

### OUs
Unlike groups, OUs can't be placed on access control lists, nor can they be placed into groups. By contrast, they are used to organize AD objects to facilitate delegation of administration and to deploy group policy settings to objects located within them..

## Server Maintenance
Shadow copies
- **read-only** by default
- **not** transportable

Scheduled backups must be performed to an **NTFS shared or local drive**
