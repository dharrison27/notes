# Installation, Storage, and Compute with Windows Server 2016: Exam Ref 70-740

## Windows Server installation
Installation of Windows Server may require careful planning

#### Installation requirements
Requires knowledge of edition, installation option (**Desktop Experience** or **Server Core**), and roles and features needed.\
An installation on a VM with the minimum single processor core and 512 MB of RAM fails, but if you reduce it to the minimum after installing with more RAM then it will run.

#### Feature comparison
Datacenter edition features not included in Standard edition

- **Shielded virtual machines** provides VMs with protection from compromised administrators that have access to the Hyper-V host computer by encrypting the VM state and virtual disks [[Zacker](#zacker): 6]
