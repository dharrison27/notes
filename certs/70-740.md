## Exam objectives
#### 1.0 Install Windows servers in host and compute environments
Skill                                                               | Links
---                                                                 | ---
**1.1** Install, upgrade, and migrate servers and workloads         | [Requirements](#requirements) • [Editions](#editions) • [Installation](#installation) • [Server Core](#server-core) • [DSC](#dsc) • [Upgrading](#upgrading)
**1.2** Install and configure Nano Server                           | 
**1.3** Create, manage, and maintain images for deployment          | 

#### Requirements
Topics to consider when planning a server deployment:
- **Editions** differ in features included, resources supported, and cost
- Installation **options** include **Desktop Experience** and **Server Core**
- **Roles and features** affect hardware resources
- **Virtualization**

Minimum requirements
- 1.4 GHz 64-bit processor
- RAM
  - Server Core: 512 MB ECC (VM installation will at first require a higher amount during install, but it can be run at this minimum level)
  - Desktop Experience: 2 GB ECC
- 32 GB SATA disk
- Gigabit Ethernet NIC
- 1024x768 (Super VGA) resolution monitor
- Keyboard and mouse
- Internet access

Maximum limits
- 512 **logical processors (LP)**
- RAM
  - Physical host: 24 TB
  - Virtual machine: 12 TB
- 64 TB VHDX size
- 1,024 VMs per host server
- 240 VM processors per host server

#### Editions
Windows Server 2016 editions:
- **Datacenter**
Datacenter edition features not included in Standard edition
  - **Storage Spaces Direct** enables administrators to use relatively inexpensive drive arrays to create high-availability storage solutions, implementing JBOD [[Zacker](#zacker): 5]
  - **Storage Replica** provides storage-agnostic, synchronous or asynchronous volume replication between local or remote servers, using SMBv3 [[Zacker](#zacker): 6]
  - **Shielded virtual machines** provides VMs with protection from compromised administrators that have access to the Hyper-V host computer by encrypting the VM state and virtual disks [[Zacker](#zacker): 6]
  - **Network controller** provides a central automation point for network infrastructure configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting [[Zacker](#zacker): 6]
- Standard
- Essentials
- MultiPoint Premium Server
- Windows Storage Server 2016 Server
- Windows Hyper-V Server 2016


#### Installation
- **Clean installation** also "bare-metal installation", installing an OS on a computer that does not already have one [[Zacker](#zacker): 6]
- **Windows Deployment Services (WDS)** role included with Windows server 2016 which can deploy disk image files to clients on the network automatically [[Zacker](#zacker): 11]
- **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)** feature built into the firmware of most network adapters that enables a computer with no OS to discover a DHCP server on the network and request a configuration from it [[Zacker](#zacker): 11]
- **Role** predefined combinations of services in Windows Server 2016 [[Zacker](#zacker): 11]
  - **Feature** component smaller than a role

#### Server Core
Unlike in Windows Server 2012, you can no longer add the Desktop Experience after OS installation

#### DSC
**Desired State Configuration (DSC)** Windows PowerShell feature that uses script files stored on a central server to apply, monitor, and maintain a specific configuration [[Zacker](#zacker): 26]\
- **Configuration scripts** scripts that are **idempotent** and contain **node blocks** specifying the names of target computers and **resource blocks** specifying property settings to be applied.
- **Resources** building blocks that specify settings or components and the values that the configuration script should assign to them
- **Local Configuration Manager (LCM)** engine running on the client system that receives configurations from the DSC server and applies them to the target computer [[Zacker](#zacker): 26]

**Management Object Format (MOF)** file created for each computer specified in the <code>Node</code> block of a DSC script, as well as the associated file format [[Zacker](#zacker): 27]

Deployment of DSC configurations [[Zacker](#zacker): 27]
- **Pull architecture** client computers' LCM creates a scheduled task to retrieve MOF file from a **Pull Server**, a SMB or IIS server with an Odata interface, set up with its own DSC configuration [[Zacker](#zacker): 27]
- **Push architecture** configured on the server using the [`Start-DscConfiguration`](#start-dscconfiguration) cmdlet [[Zacker](#zacker): 27]

Sample DSC configuration [[Zacker](#zacker): 27-8]
- `Configuration` specifies name of the configuration
- `Import-DscResource` loads specified module
- `Node` specifies target configures
- `xDnsServerAddress` specifies resource in the module to be configured, i.e. `DnsServer`
- `Address` specifies DNS server address
- `AddressFamily` specifies IP version of the DNS address
- `InterfaceAlias` specifies network adapter to be configured
```dsc
Configuration DnsClient
{
  Import-DscResource -ModuleName "xNetworking"
  Node ("ServerA","ServerB")
  {
    xDnsServerAddress DnsServer
    {
      Address=10.0.0.1
      AddressFamily="Ipv4"
      InterfaceAlias="Ethernet"
}}}
```

#### Upgrading
Migrations are recommended over upgrades [[Zacker](#zacker): 27-8]
- **Migration** clean installation on a new computer with old data transferred over
- **Upgrade** installation performed in-place with existing data intact

Upgrade limitations
- There is no direct upgrade path to 2016 from versions prior to 2012, but a two-step upgrade is possible.
- Windows Server 2012 editions can be upgraded to equivalent 2016 editions, and 2012 Standard can be upgraded to 2016, but upgrades from Datacenter edition to Standard are not possible.
- Upgrades from 32-bit to 64-bit, one installation option to another, one language to another, and from workstation OSes to Server are not supported.
