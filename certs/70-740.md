#### Requirements
Topics to consider when planning a server deployment:
- **Editions** differ in features included, resources supported, and cost
- Installation **options** include **Desktop Experience** and **Server Core**
- **Roles and features** affect hardware resources
- **Virtualization**

Minimum requirements
- 1.4 GHz 64-bit processor
- RAM
  - Server Core: 512 MB ECC (VM installation will at first require a higher amount during install, but it can be run at this minimum level)
  - Desktop Experience: 2 GB ECC
- 32 GB SATA disk
- Gigabit Ethernet NIC
- 1024x768 (Super VGA) resolution monitor
- Keyboard and mouse
- Internet access

Maximum limits
- 512 **logical processors (LP)**
- RAM
  - Physical host: 24 TB
  - Virtual machine: 12 TB
- 64 TB VHDX size
- 1,024 VMs per host server
- 240 VM processors per host server

#### Editions
Windows Server 2016 editions:
- **Datacenter**
Datacenter edition features not included in Standard edition [[Zacker](#sources): 5-6]
  - **Storage Spaces Direct** enables administrators to use relatively inexpensive drive arrays to create high-availability storage solutions, implementing JBOD
  - **Storage Replica** provides storage-agnostic, synchronous or asynchronous volume replication between local or remote servers, using SMBv3
  - **Shielded virtual machines** provides VMs with protection from compromised administrators that have access to the Hyper-V host computer by encrypting the VM state and virtual disks
  - **Network controller** provides a central automation point for network infrastructure configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting
- Standard
- Essentials
- MultiPoint Premium Server
- Windows Storage Server 2016 Server
- Windows Hyper-V Server 2016


#### Installation
- **Clean installation** also "bare-metal installation", installing an OS on a computer that does not already have one [[^][Zacker]: 6]
- **Windows Deployment Services (WDS)** role included with Windows server 2016 which can deploy disk image files to clients on the network automatically [[^][Zacker]: 11]
- **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)** feature built into the firmware of most network adapters that enables a computer with no OS to discover a DHCP server on the network and request a configuration from it [[^][Zacker]: 11]
- **Role** predefined combinations of services in Windows Server 2016 [[^][Zacker]: 11]
  - **Feature** component smaller than a role

#### Server Core
Unlike in Windows Server 2012, you can no longer add the Desktop Experience after OS installation

#### Upgrading
Migrations are recommended over upgrades [[^][Zacker]: 27-8]
- **Migration** clean installation on a new computer with old data transferred over
- **Upgrade** installation performed in-place with existing data intact

Upgrade limitations
- There is no direct upgrade path to 2016 from versions prior to 2012, but a two-step upgrade is possible.
- Windows Server 2012 editions can be upgraded to equivalent 2016 editions, and 2012 Standard can be upgraded to 2016, but upgrades from Datacenter edition to Standard are not possible.
- Upgrades from 32-bit to 64-bit, one installation option to another, one language to another, and from workstation OSes to Server are not supported.
