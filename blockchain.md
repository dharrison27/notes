# Blockchain
Blockchain is a database technology that uses hashes to ensure reliability and security of data stored across a network of computers, popularized by BitCoin. Records, containing information, are validated and then added to **Blocks**, or hashed containers, which are then concatenated in a **chain** by associating each block with the hash of both of its neighbors.
