# Konsole
## Configuration
Color configuration is stored in two types of files 
  1. `.profile` files $HOME/.local/share/konsole
  2. `.colorscheme` files in /usr/share/konsole/
Profiles are more immediately selectable within the GUI and may refer to any colorscheme using the following syntax: `ColorScheme=colorscheme` where {colorscheme} refers to the filename of a colorscheme file, including spaces.
